In this pratical application, I built linear regression models to identify key factors that can impact the price of a used car.
The dataset includes informations of the price from 250K used cars and multiple columns with information that may be relevant to the price.
Data preprocessing is needed to clean up the data and make them ready for modeling. 
I explored both Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. The dataset was splitted into training set and test set. The optimal value for the superparameter alpha were chosen based on minimized MSE in test set.
Both models come to the similar conclusion. Odometer, year, cylinders, drive, condition, type, fuel are important factors that determine the price of a used car.
